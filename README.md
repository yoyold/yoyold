### Hi there 👋

My name is Lukas and I am a aspiring software developer from 🇩🇪. Here are some quick facts about me:
-  🔭 I am currently working in an international team for pos ("point-of-sale") systems.
-  🌱 Currently learning: Java ♨️ and attending [Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-artifical-intelligence) on edX by Harvard University.
</br>
Reminder: My personal projects are still very much work in progress, but I'm happy if you have a look at them.
Bugs are my own of course 🫣

</br>📫 Feel free to reach out to me
